# Machine Learning
This repository is a collection of the experiments I performed during my college laboratories of Machine Learning. These are raw implementations of the algorithms used for underatanding the working of the algorithms. I built this repository as a humble and unpretentious effort to help students. 

It includes:
1. Agglomerative Clustering
2. Apriori
3. ID3
4. KMean
5. KMedoid
6. KNN
7. Linear Regression
8. Logistic Regression
9. Naive Bayes
10. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
